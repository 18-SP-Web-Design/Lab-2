# Web Page Design - Spring 2018

## Lab-2 - Basic Tags and Inline Styles

**Discussion:** Everybody starts somewhere. There are two parts to this Lab.

1. Complete the first two Lab assignments in the chapter. The directions are on pages 83-84 of the text. The files are included in this repository. 
1. Create your own web page about any subject you like. Like the other pages, it can be in the root folder of this repository (this should be simple to do on Codeanywhere). It must include examples of each of the following:
  * Different font colors
  * Different font sizes
  * Heading tags
  * Alignment (centering)
  * At least one image

Keep everything in the same workspace so that you can push the entire repository in one shot when you are finished.

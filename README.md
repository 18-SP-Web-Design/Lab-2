# Web Page Design - Spring 2018

## Lab-2 - Basic Tags and Inline Styles

**Discussion:** Everybody starts somewhere. There are two parts to this Lab.

1. Complete the first two Lab assignments in the chapter. The directions are on pages 83-84 of the text. The files are included in this repository. 
1. Complete **Cases and Places** exercise 2 on page 86. Use the inline style techniques and tags that you have learned in this chapter tastefully.

Keep everything in the same workspace so that you can push the entire repository in one shot when you are finished.
